Interview-AI is a web application which helps you practice your interview skills. It works by asking you a behavourial question analyzing your answer. Based on what your speech and facial expressions, it gives you a report containing the following information:

* **Speaking rate**: Tells you at what speed (wpm) you were speaking and whether your speaking-rate was correct or you should increase or decrease your speed.
* **Most used words**: Shows a bar-chart representing the words used most by you in your speech.
* **Emotional analysis**: Shows a pie chart showing the amount of emotions(happy, sad, joy, fear, disgust, etc.) in your speech.
* **Word Cloud**: Creates a word-cloud of most-important keywords and concepts of your speech
* **Facial analysis**: Gives the list of emotions seen on your face while giving interview. It also gives other information like age, gender and smile.
