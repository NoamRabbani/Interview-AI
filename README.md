Interview-AI is a web application which helps you practice for interview. It asks you an interview question and you have to answer that question. Based on what you said and expressions on your face, it gives you a report containing the following:

* **Speaking rate**: Tells you at what speed(wpm) you were speaking and whether your speaking-rate was correct or you should increase or decrease your speed.
* **Most used words**: Shows a bar-chart representing the words used most by you in your speech.
* **Emotional analysis**: Shows a pie chart showing the amount of emotions(happy, sad, joy, fear, disgust, etc.) in your speech.
* **Word Cloud**: Creates a word-cloud of most-important keywords and concepts of your speech
* **Facial analysis**: Gives the list of emotions seen on your face while giving interview. It also gives other information like age, gender and smile.
